# A PACMAN clone written with Bevy and Rust

Bevy version: 0.14.1

All graphics live in the assets folder alongside the source files for the images. Images and graphics were created by myself (if you couldn't tell!) using gimp2 image editor.

Not all images in the assets folder are used.

Code files are split by functionality.

This is my first time using rust so lots of initial learning going on here.
